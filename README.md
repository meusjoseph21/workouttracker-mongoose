# Workout Tracker

  ## Description

  The workout tracker allows users to create new workouts and add on to their previous workout. The workout tracker also keeps a stats page of the last seven workouts and the combined weights of those workouts. This is good for users because they can continue to develop their workout based on their needs tthroughout the week. The workout tracker was made using express and mongoose. Seed files were entered via mongoDB atlas so that users can get and idea of what a 7 day workout would project like.
